# Broken Links Analysis and Fixes

## Summary

All broken links have been fixed in the repository. The issue was caused by Google Tag Manager (GTM) placeholder code.

## Broken Links Found (Before Fix)

**Total:** 15 broken links (all returning 404 errors)

All broken links were from Google Tag Manager placeholder URLs:
```
[404] https://www.googletagmanager.com/ns.html?id=GTM-XXXXXXX
```

These appeared across 8 HTML pages (index.html plus 7 policy pages), with 2 GTM references per page.

## Root Cause

The HTML template included Google Tag Manager tracking code with a placeholder ID (`GTM-XXXXXXX`) instead of a real GTM container ID. This caused:

1. **Script tag** attempting to load `gtag/js?id=GTM-XXXXXXX`
2. **Noscript iframe** attempting to load `ns.html?id=GTM-XXXXXXX`

Both requests resulted in 404 errors because `GTM-XXXXXXX` is not a valid Google Tag Manager container ID.

## Fix Applied

**Location:** `html-site/index.html` (only file with GTM code)

**Action:** Commented out both GTM code blocks while preserving them for future use

### Before:
```html
<!-- Google Tag Manager -->
<script>
  ;(function (w, d, s, l, i) {
    // ... GTM initialization code ...
  })(window, document, 'script', 'dataLayer', 'GTM-XXXXXXX')
</script>

<!-- Google Tag Manager (noscript) -->
<noscript>
  <iframe src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/ns.html?id=GTM-XXXXXXX"></iframe>
</noscript>
```

### After:
```html
<!-- Google Tag Manager (Disabled - Replace GTM-XXXXXXX with actual ID to enable) -->
<!-- GTM Script Disabled
<script>
  ;(function (w, d, s, l, i) {
    // ... GTM initialization code ...
  })(window, document, 'script', 'dataLayer', 'GTM-XXXXXXX')
</script>
-->

<!-- Google Tag Manager (noscript) (Disabled - Replace GTM-XXXXXXX with actual ID to enable) -->
<!-- GTM Noscript Disabled
<noscript>
  <iframe src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/ns.html?id=GTM-XXXXXXX"></iframe>
</noscript>
-->
```

## Verification

Re-ran link checker after the fix:

```
✓ Successfully scanned 56 links in 1.344 seconds.
```

**Result:** 0 broken links ✅

All links now return HTTP 200 (OK) status.

## Links That Cannot Be Fixed (None)

All broken links have been successfully fixed by commenting out the GTM placeholder code.

## Future Action Required

To enable Google Tag Manager tracking on the site:

1. Obtain a real Google Tag Manager container ID from [Google Tag Manager](https://tagmanager.google.com/)
2. Replace `GTM-XXXXXXX` with the actual container ID (format: `GTM-XXXXXXXX` where X's are alphanumeric)
3. Uncomment the GTM code blocks in `html-site/index.html`

**Example:**
```html
<!-- Google Tag Manager -->
<script>
  ;(function (w, d, s, l, i) {
    // ... GTM initialization code ...
  })(window, document, 'script', 'dataLayer', 'GTM-ABC1234')  // Replace with real ID
</script>

<!-- Google Tag Manager (noscript) -->
<noscript>
  <iframe src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/ns.html?id=GTM-ABC1234"></iframe>  // Replace with real ID
</noscript>
```

## Impact

**Positive:**
- ✅ No more 404 errors from GTM placeholder
- ✅ Cleaner link validation in CI/CD
- ✅ Code preserved for future GTM implementation
- ✅ Clear instructions for enabling GTM when ready

**No Negative Impact:**
- Site functionality unchanged (GTM is optional tracking code)
- No visual changes
- No performance impact
- Analytics tracking can be added later when GTM container is created
