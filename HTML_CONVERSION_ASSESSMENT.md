## ✅ Success Criteria Met

- [x] Homepage structure converted to HTML
- [x] All policy pages created with full content
- [x] Header/navigation working (desktop + mobile)
- [x] Footer with all links working
- [x] Cookie consent system functional
- [x] Google Tag Manager integrated

## Conclusion

The React to HTML conversion is **approximately 85% complete**. The core functionality is fully working, all policy pages are complete, and the site is functional. However, **two important homepage sections are missing** (Testimonials and Endowment Features) which should be added to achieve 100% feature parity with the React site.

The test suite exists and is configured to test the HTML site, but needs to be run and verified. Documentation is mostly complete but needs updates to reflect the current status.

**Estimated time to 100% completion:** 15-20 hours of work across the remaining tasks.
