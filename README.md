## Deployment

The site is automatically deployed to the custom apex domain when changes are pushed to the `main` branch.

- **Production URL**: https://ffcworkingsite2.org/
- **Deployment**: Via GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) to GitHub Pages with custom domain
- **Custom Domain**: Configured via `CNAME` file in `html-site/` directory
- **No Build Step**: Pure HTML files are served directly from the `html-site/` directory

### ⚠️ Custom Domain Dependency

**Important**: This site has a critical dependency on the custom domain (ffcworkingsite2.org). All asset paths are root-relative (e.g., `/css/styles.css`, `/images/`), which requires the site to be served from a domain root.

**Implications**:
- The site will **NOT** work if accessed via the GitHub Pages subpath URL (https://freeforcharity.github.io/FFC-IN-Single_Page_Template_HTML/)
- The `CNAME` file in `html-site/` is critical for proper deployment
- If the custom domain expires, becomes misconfigured, or is removed, the site will be broken

**Operational Requirements**:
1. **Domain Renewal**: Ensure ffcworkingsite2.org domain renewal is monitored and automated
2. **CNAME File**: Never remove or modify the `html-site/CNAME` file without updating asset paths
3. **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for domain expiration and SSL certificate renewal

**Contingency Plan**:
If the custom domain becomes unavailable and the site needs to work on the GitHub Pages URL, you must:
1. Restore the basePath prefix to all asset paths (revert to the commit before basePath removal, or manually add the prefix)
2. Update all `/css/` → `/FFC-IN-Single_Page_Template_HTML/css/`
3. Update all `/images/` → `/FFC-IN-Single_Page_Template_HTML/images/`
4. Update all navigation `/#section` → `/FFC-IN-Single_Page_Template_HTML/#section`

## Local Development

No build process or dependencies required! Simply open the HTML files in your browser:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/FreeForCharity/FFC-IN-Single_Page_Template_HTML.git
cd FFC-IN-Single_Page_Template_HTML

# Open in browser
cd html-site
open index.html  # macOS
# or
xdg-open index.html  # Linux
# or just double-click index.html in Windows
```

### Using a Local HTTP Server (Optional)

For testing features that require a web server (like cookies or CORS):

```bash
# Using Python (usually pre-installed)
cd html-site
python3 -m http.server 8000
# Visit http://localhost:8000

# Or using PHP (if installed)
cd html-site
php -S localhost:8000

# Or using Node.js http-server (if you have Node installed)
npx http-server html-site -p 8000
```

---

## Testing

The repository includes Playwright E2E tests to validate HTML site functionality:

```bash
# Install dependencies (first time only)
npm install

# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests with UI
npm run test:ui

# Run tests in headed mode (see browser)
npm run test:headed
```

Tests validate:
- Page loading and navigation
- Image rendering
- Cookie consent functionality
- Form functionality
- Social media links
- Copyright information
- Mobile responsiveness

See [tests/README.md](./tests/README.md) for detailed testing documentation.

## Making Changes

1. Edit HTML, CSS, or JavaScript files in the `html-site/` directory
2. Test locally in your browser
3. Commit and push to the `main` branch
4. GitHub Actions will automatically deploy to GitHub Pages

### File Organization

- **CSS**: All styles in `html-site/css/styles.css`
- **JavaScript**: Functionality in `html-site/js/main.js`
- **Assets**: Images in `images/`, SVGs in `svgs/`, videos in `videos/`
