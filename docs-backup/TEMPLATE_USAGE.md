## Essential GitHub Repository Settings

These settings must be configured for your repository to function properly with all features enabled.

### 1. General Repository Settings

**Location**: Settings → General

1. **Repository name**: Use kebab-case for SEO (e.g., `nonprofit-website-template`)
2. **Description**: Add a clear description of your website
3. **Topics**: Add relevant topics (e.g., `nextjs`, `nonprofit`, `website`, `static-site`)
4. **Features**:
   - ✅ Enable **Issues**
   - ✅ Enable **Discussions** (optional, for community engagement)
   - ✅ Enable **Projects** (optional, for project management)
   - ✅ Enable **Wiki** (optional, for additional documentation)

### 2. GitHub Pages Configuration

**Location**: Settings → Pages

**Required for deployment to work:**

1. **Source**: Select **"Deploy from a branch"**
2. **Branch**: Select **`gh-pages`** branch and **`/ (root)`** folder
   - The deploy workflow automatically creates and manages the `gh-pages` branch
   - Do NOT use the `main` branch directly for Pages
3. **Custom domain** (optional):
   - Enter your custom domain (e.g., `www.yournonprofit.org`)
   - Wait for DNS check to complete
   - Enable **Enforce HTTPS** after DNS is configured

**DNS Configuration for Custom Domain:**

If using a custom domain, configure these DNS records with your domain provider:

For root domain (`yournonprofit.org`):

```
Type: A
Name: @
Value: 185.199.108.153
Value: 185.199.109.153
Value: 185.199.110.153
Value: 185.199.111.153
```

For www subdomain (`www.yournonprofit.org`):

```
Type: CNAME
Name: www
Value: YOUR-ORG.github.io
```

**IMPORTANT**: After configuring GitHub Pages, verify the deployment:

1. Wait 2-5 minutes for first deployment to complete
2. Visit your GitHub Pages URL: `https://YOUR-ORG.github.io/YOUR-REPO-NAME/`
3. Verify the site loads correctly
4. Check the Actions tab to see the deployment status

### 3. Actions Permissions

**Location**: Settings → Actions → General

**Required for workflows to run:**

1. **Actions permissions**:
   - Select **"Allow all actions and reusable workflows"**
   - OR select **"Allow [YOUR-ORG] actions and reusable workflows"** for more security
2. **Workflow permissions**:
   - Select **"Read and write permissions"**
   - ✅ Enable **"Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"**
     - Required for Dependabot to work properly
     - Allows workflows to comment on PRs (Lighthouse CI results)

**Why these permissions are needed:**

- **Read and write permissions**: Allows deploy workflow to push to `gh-pages` branch
- **Create and approve PRs**: Allows Dependabot to create PRs and workflows to post comments
- Without these permissions, deployments will fail and Dependabot won't function

### 4. Environments

**Location**: Settings → Environments

The deploy workflow creates a `github-pages` environment automatically. You can optionally add protection rules:

1. Click on **`github-pages`** environment (created after first deployment)
2. **Deployment protection rules** (optional):
   - Add required reviewers for production deployments
   - Set deployment branches to `main` only
   - Add custom deployment protection rules

---

## GitHub Actions Configuration

### Workflows Overview

This template includes four GitHub Actions workflows:

1. **CI - Build and Test** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
   - Runs on: All pull requests and pushes to main
   - Purpose: Validates code quality before deployment
   - What it does: Format check, linting, unit tests, build, E2E tests

2. **Deploy to GitHub Pages** (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)
   - Runs on: After CI workflow succeeds on main branch
   - Purpose: Deploys built site to GitHub Pages
   - What it does: Builds site with basePath, deploys to `gh-pages` branch

3. **CodeQL Security Scanning** (`.github/workflows/codeql.yml`)
   - Runs on: Push to main, PRs to main, weekly schedule
   - Purpose: Scans code for security vulnerabilities
   - What it does: Analyzes JavaScript/TypeScript and GitHub Actions

4. **Lighthouse CI** (`.github/workflows/lighthouse.yml`)
   - Runs on: After deployment, PRs to main
   - Purpose: Monitors performance and quality metrics
   - What it does: Runs Lighthouse audits, posts results to PRs

### Workflow Dependencies

The workflows are designed to run in sequence:

```
Push to main → CI Workflow → Deploy Workflow → Lighthouse Workflow
                    ↓
                  (must pass)
```

**Important**: The deploy workflow only runs if CI workflow succeeds. This ensures:

- All tests pass before deployment
- Code is formatted and linted
- No broken functionality reaches production

### Secrets Configuration

Most workflows don't require secrets, but some optional features do:

#### Optional: Lighthouse CI Token

**Location**: Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions

To enable Lighthouse CI GitHub integration features:

1. Click **"New repository secret"**
2. **Name**: `LHCI_GITHUB_APP_TOKEN`
3. **Value**: Create a **fine-grained** GitHub personal access token, limited to this repository and with only the minimal permissions required for Lighthouse CI (avoid using a classic token with broad `repo` scope).
4. Click **"Add secret"**

**Note**: With the current filesystem storage configuration in `lighthouserc.json`, Lighthouse CI still runs and stores results locally without this secret. The `LHCI_GITHUB_APP_TOKEN` is only required to enable GitHub integration features such as status checks, annotations, and PR comments for Lighthouse reports.

### Customizing basePath for Your Repository

The deploy workflow sets `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH` for GitHub Pages routing:

```yaml
env:
  NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH: /FFC_Single_Page_Template
```

**This needs to be updated** in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` and `.github/workflows/lighthouse.yml`:

**Option A: Using AI/Copilot (Recommended)**

- Ask Copilot: "Update `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH` in both `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` and `.github/workflows/lighthouse.yml` from `/FFC_Single_Page_Template` to `/YOUR-REPO-NAME`"
- Copilot will automatically find and replace the values in both files

**Option B: Manual Update**

1. Open `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
2. Search for `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH: /FFC_Single_Page_Template`
3. Replace with your repository name, for example: `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH: /YOUR-REPO-NAME`
4. Repeat steps 1–3 for `.github/workflows/lighthouse.yml`
5. Commit the changes

**If using a custom domain**: You can ask Copilot to remove the `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH` line from both workflow files, as custom domains don't need a basePath.

---

## Security and Quality Settings

### 1. Branch Protection Rules

**Location**: Settings → Rules → Rulesets

Create a ruleset named **"Protect Main"** with these settings:

#### Basic Settings

1. **Ruleset name**: `Protect Main`
2. **Enforcement status**: Active
3. **Target branches**: Include default branch (`main`)

#### Required Rules

1. ✅ **Restrict deletions**
   - Prevents accidental deletion of main branch
   - Only admins can delete

2. ✅ **Require a pull request before merging**
   - Prevents direct pushes to main
   - Forces all changes through PR review process
   - Recommended: Require 1 approval

3. ✅ **Require status checks to pass**
   - Select these status checks as required:
     - `Test and Build` (from CI workflow)
     - `Analyze (javascript-typescript)` (from CodeQL)
     - `Analyze (actions)` (from CodeQL)
   - ✅ Enable **"Require branches to be up to date before merging"**
   - This ensures tests run on latest code before merge

4. ✅ **Require signed commits**
   - Ensures all commits are cryptographically signed
   - Prevents unauthorized code injection
   - See [GitHub's commit signing guide](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits)

5. ✅ **Block force pushes**
   - Prevents rewriting commit history
   - Protects against accidental data loss

#### Optional but Recommended Rules

1. **Require code scanning results**
   - Requires CodeQL security analysis to pass
   - Blocks merges if vulnerabilities are found

2. **Require deployments to succeed**
   - Ensures deployment workflow completes successfully
   - Select `github-pages` environment

**Setting up commit signing** (required for contributors):

```bash
# Generate GPG key
gpg --gen-key

# Get your GPG key ID
gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format=long

# Configure Git to use it
git config --global user.signingkey YOUR_KEY_ID
git config --global commit.gpgsign true

# Add GPG key to GitHub
gpg --armor --export YOUR_KEY_ID
# Copy output and add to GitHub: Settings → SSH and GPG keys → New GPG key
```

### 2. Security and Analysis Features

**Location**: Settings → Security & Analysis

**Required - Enable these features:**

1. ✅ **Dependency graph**
   - Automatically detects dependencies
   - Required for Dependabot functionality
   - Should be enabled by default

2. ✅ **Dependabot alerts**
   - Alerts you to vulnerable dependencies
   - Click **"Enable"** if not already enabled
   - Free for all repositories

3. ✅ **Dependabot security updates**
   - Automatically creates PRs to fix vulnerabilities
   - Click **"Enable"** if not already enabled
   - Works immediately when vulnerabilities are detected

4. ✅ **Code scanning (CodeQL)**
   - Should be automatically enabled by the workflow
   - Verify it's listed under "Code scanning alerts"
   - If not, the workflow will set it up on first run

**Recommended:**

1. ✅ **Secret scanning**
   - Scans for leaked secrets and tokens
   - Available for public repositories (always enabled)
   - Available for private repositories with GitHub Advanced Security

2. ✅ **Push protection**
   - Blocks pushes that contain secrets
   - Available for public repositories
   - Prevents accidental credential exposure

### 3. Dependabot Configuration

The template includes `.github/dependabot.yml` for automated dependency updates.

**Verify configuration**:

1. Check that `.github/dependabot.yml` exists
2. Ensure Dependabot alerts are enabled (Settings → Security & Analysis)
3. Ensure Dependabot security updates are enabled
4. Wait for first Dependabot run (Mondays at 9:00 AM UTC)

**Expected behavior**:

- Weekly PRs for npm dependency updates (grouped by production/development)
- Weekly PRs for GitHub Actions version updates
- Immediate PRs for security vulnerabilities
- PRs are labeled with `dependencies` and ecosystem tags

**Monitoring Dependabot**:

- View open Dependabot PRs: Filter PRs by author `dependabot[bot]`
- View security alerts: Security tab → Dependabot alerts
- View update insights: Insights tab → Dependency graph → Dependabot

See [DEPENDABOT.md](./DEPENDABOT.md) for complete Dependabot documentation.

### 4. CODEOWNERS Configuration

**Location**: `.github/CODEOWNERS`

Update the CODEOWNERS file to automatically request reviews from your team:

1. Open `.github/CODEOWNERS`
2. Replace `@clarkemoyer` with your GitHub usernames/teams
3. Example:

   ```
   # Default owners for everything
   * @your-username @your-team-name

   # Security files
   /SECURITY.md @security-team

   # Workflows
   /.github/workflows/ @devops-team
   ```

4. Commit the changes

**What CODEOWNERS does**:

- Automatically requests reviews from specified users/teams
- Shows ownership information in GitHub's file browser
- Helps distribute review responsibility
- Works in conjunction with branch protection rules

---

## Optional Features

### 1. GitHub Sponsors

**Location**: `.github/FUNDING.yml`

The template includes a FUNDING.yml file for GitHub Sponsors button:

```yaml
github: FreeForCharity
custom:
  - 'https://ffcworkingsite1.org'
  - 'https://ffcworkingsite1.org/#donate'
```

**To customize**:

1. Open `.github/FUNDING.yml`
2. Replace `FreeForCharity` with your GitHub org/username
3. Update custom links to your donation pages
4. Commit the changes
5. The "Sponsor" button will appear in your repository header

**Note**: You must have GitHub Sponsors enabled for your organization/account.

### 2. Lighthouse CI GitHub Integration

To enable Lighthouse CI to post detailed results and comments on pull requests:

1. Create a fine-grained GitHub Personal Access Token (recommended):
   - Go to GitHub **Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Fine-grained tokens**
   - Click **"Generate new token"**
   - Name: `Lighthouse CI`
   - Resource owner: Select your user or a dedicated bot account
   - Repository access: Choose **"Only select repositories"** and select this repository (and any others that need Lighthouse CI)
   - Permissions: Grant repository **read** access and **pull requests: write** access (required for posting PR comments via the Lighthouse workflow)
   - Click **"Generate token"** and copy it

2. Add the token to repository secrets:
   - Go to your repository **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**
   - Click **"New repository secret"**
   - Name: `LHCI_GITHUB_APP_TOKEN`
   - Value: Paste your fine-grained token
   - Click **"Add secret"**

3. Lighthouse CI will now be able to post PR comments with detailed performance reports

**Security note**: Avoid using classic personal access tokens with broad `repo` scope for CI. If you must use a classic token, restrict it to the smallest possible set of repositories and permissions, or use a dedicated bot account.

**Without this token**: Lighthouse CI still runs and generates reports locally (stored in `.lighthouseci` directory), but cannot post results as PR comments or GitHub status checks. The workflow will upload reports as artifacts that you can download manually.

**Note**: The current configuration uses filesystem storage (`lighthouserc.json`). If you want to enable historical trend tracking, you would need to configure a Lighthouse Server or use the temporary public storage option by changing the upload target in `lighthouserc.json`.

### 3. Preview Deployments (Cloudflare Pages or Vercel)

The template works great with preview deployment services:

#### Option A: Cloudflare Pages (Recommended)

**Why Cloudflare Pages**:

- Unlimited bandwidth (vs Vercel's 100GB/month)
- Most likely to remain free long-term
- Excellent Next.js static export support
- Automatic PR preview deployments

**Setup steps**:

1. Sign up at [pages.cloudflare.com](https://pages.cloudflare.com)
2. Connect your GitHub repository
3. Configure build settings:
   - **Framework preset**: Next.js (Static HTML Export)
   - **Build command**: `npm run build`
   - **Build output directory**: `out`
   - **Environment variables**: Leave `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH` empty
4. Enable "Automatic preview deployments"
5. Enable "Comments on pull requests"

**Result**: Every PR gets a preview URL automatically posted as a comment.

#### Option B: Vercel

**Setup steps**:

1. Sign up at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Import your GitHub repository
3. Configure:
   - **Framework Preset**: Next.js
   - **Build Command**: `npm run build`
   - **Output Directory**: `out`
4. Deploy

**Result**: Automatic preview deployments for every PR with Vercel comments.

**Note**: Both services work alongside GitHub Pages - use them for PR previews, keep GitHub Pages for production.

### 4. Issue and PR Templates

The template includes comprehensive issue and PR templates:

**Location**: `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` and `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`

**Available templates**:

- Bug report
- Feature request
- Documentation improvement
- Reviewer onboarding

**Customization**:

1. Review templates in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`
2. Customize labels, assignees, and content for your workflow
3. Edit `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml` to update support links
4. Commit changes

### 5. Merge Queue

GitHub merge queues help prevent merge conflicts and ensure all PRs are tested together before merging.

**To enable**:

1. Go to Settings → General → Pull Requests
2. Scroll to "Merge queue"
3. ✅ Enable merge queue
4. Configure settings:
   - **Merge method**: Choose your preferred method (squash, merge, rebase)
   - **Required status checks**: Add same checks as branch protection
   - **Maximum merge queue size**: 5-10 (recommended)
   - **Merge queue check interval**: 5 minutes (recommended)

**Benefits**:

- Prevents "merge train" conflicts
- Ensures all PRs pass tests with latest main branch code
- Automatically rebases and tests PRs before merging

## Reducing Template Setup Burden

This template has been designed to minimize post-creation configuration. Here are the features that require no additional setup:

### ✅ Already Configured (No Action Needed)

- **Next.js static export** - Works out of the box
- **TypeScript** - Fully configured with strict mode
- **Tailwind CSS** - Complete setup with custom configuration
- **ESLint and Prettier** - Code quality tools pre-configured
- **Pre-commit hooks (Husky)** - Automatically enforces code quality
- **Jest unit tests** - Testing framework ready to use
- **Playwright E2E tests** - E2E testing configured
- **GitHub Actions CI** - Continuous integration workflow ready
- **Dependabot config file** - Version updates pre-configured
- **Issue and PR templates** - Complete set of templates
- **Community health files** - Code of conduct, security policy, contributing guide
- **SEO optimization** - Metadata, sitemap, robots.txt configured

### ⚙️ Requires GitHub Settings (One-Time Setup)

These settings cannot be included in the template files and must be configured through GitHub's web interface:

- **GitHub Pages deployment** - Must be enabled in repository settings
- **Actions permissions** - Must grant read/write permissions
- **Dependabot features** - Must enable alerts and security updates
- **Branch protection rules** - Must configure rulesets for main branch
- **Environment protection** - Optional deployment protection rules

### 🎨 Requires Customization (Expected)

These items are specific to your organization and must be customized:

- Organization name, EIN, and contact information
- Logo and branding assets
- Social media links
- Team member information
- FAQs and testimonials
- Custom domain name
- CODEOWNERS file

### Future Improvements to Reduce Setup Burden

The issue mentions "reducing the number of settings that need to occur." Here are potential improvements:

1. **Repository Template Settings**: GitHub is working on allowing templates to include repository settings like branch protection rules and Actions permissions. When available, this template will be updated to include these settings.

2. **First-Run Setup Script**: We could add an interactive CLI script that:
   - Guides through required settings
   - Updates configuration files automatically
   - Generates checklists of manual steps needed
   - Validates GitHub settings via API

3. **GitHub API Automation**: For organizations managing multiple repositories, a setup automation script could:
   - Enable GitHub Pages via API
   - Configure branch protection rules
   - Enable security features
   - Set up environments
   - However, this requires GitHub API access tokens with admin permissions

4. **Documentation Generator**: A tool that:
   - Scans your repository
   - Detects which settings are configured
   - Generates a personalized checklist of remaining tasks

5. **Content Customization Script**: A CLI tool that reduces manual find-and-replace work when adapting for a new charity:
   - Interactive prompts for organization details (name, EIN, domain, contact info)
   - Automated search-and-replace across all files
   - Generates checklist of remaining manual customizations (logos, team photos, FAQs, testimonials)
   - Validates that all placeholders have been replaced
   - Example usage: `npm run customize-for-charity`

### Reducing Manual Steps for New Charity Customization

When adapting this template for a new charity, many tasks can be automated using AI/Copilot:

**Tasks That Can Be Fully Automated by Copilot:**

After completing the "Rebrand Template To A New Brand" issue with all required information, you can assign these tasks to Copilot:

- Organization name replacement: "Free For Charity" → Your charity name
- EIN replacement: "46-2471893" → Your EIN
- Domain replacement: "ffcworkingsite1.org" → Your domain
- Contact email updates: Multiple files with contact information
- Social media links: Footer and other components
- CODEOWNERS updates: GitHub usernames
- Workflow basePath updates: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` and `.github/workflows/lighthouse.yml`

**Example Copilot Instructions:**

```
Based on the information in issue #[number], update all instances of:
- "Free For Charity" to "[New Org Name]"
- "46-2471893" to "[New EIN]"
- "ffcworkingsite1.org" to "[new-domain.org]"
- Update CODEOWNERS with @[username1], @[username2]
- Update NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH in both workflow files to /[new-repo-name]
- Update all social media links in footer components
```

**Tasks That Require Manual File Uploads:**

These cannot be automated by AI and require manual work:

- Logo files (`/public/logo.svg`, `/public/favicon.ico`) - Must upload new files
- Team member photos (`/public/team/`) - Must upload new images
- Team member data (`src/data/team/*.json`) - Can be updated by Copilot with provided information
- FAQs (`src/data/faqs/*.json`) - Can be updated by Copilot with provided Q&A content
- Testimonials (`src/data/testimonials/*.json`) - Can be updated by Copilot with provided testimonial text

**Optimal Workflow:**

1. **Complete GitHub Web UI Settings First** (manual, cannot be automated)
   - Repository settings, GitHub Pages, Actions permissions, etc.

2. **Fill Out Rebrand Issue Template** (manual data collection)
   - Provide all organization details, board member info, content, etc.

3. **Assign Bulk Updates to Copilot** (automated text replacements)
   - Copilot handles all text-based find-and-replace operations
   - Updates workflow configurations, CODEOWNERS, data files
   - **Time estimate: 5-10 minutes for Copilot to complete**

4. **Upload Binary Files** (manual file uploads)
   - Upload logos, photos, and other assets
   - **Time estimate: 15-30 minutes**

5. **Review and Test** (manual verification)
   - Verify all changes are correct
   - Test site locally with `npm run dev`
   - **Time estimate: 15-30 minutes**

**Total Time with AI Assistance: 35-70 minutes** (vs. 8-12 hours fully manual)

**Note**: Most of the setup burden comes from GitHub security features that are intentionally not automated (branch protection, security scanning, etc.). This is by design - these settings should be explicitly reviewed and enabled by repository administrators rather than automatically inherited.
