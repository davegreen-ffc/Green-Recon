                Wave is the basic accounting that you need as an ultra small business or a
                consultant. Use this first and if you outgrow it and have to move to the very
                expensive QuickBooks later then it is no problem. Wave gets better every year and
                adds more and more features. I use this for several of my small businesses

                Shoeboxed is a North Carolina based document scanning company that takes basically
                any paper you get for your business and scans it with OCR and human oversight to
                ensure it is accurate. In the free version you have to upload the documents by
                tracking a picture but in the paid versions you can just put them in pre-paid
                envelopes and mail them in for processing. This is an amazing tool if you need more
                things scanned than just receipts and invoices like what is now included in the free
                wave accounting software. NOTE: I use the paid version of this for some of my
                businesses

                This product I have used because I use Google for the personal side. This is the
                business version. Now that Office 365 has come out I am starting to think of moving
                my services over to that and may change this recommendation for office productivity
                and email on a budget. Microsoft Office was always expected on top of this and that
                moved the needle to thinking Office 365 may overtake it.
